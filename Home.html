<p class="secondparag">
    <span style="color: rgb(121, 119, 119);" font wieght="bold"> Apple McAfee Maggart</span> (born September 13, 1977) 
    is an Anerican singer-songwriter, pianist and record<br>
    producer. Classically trained on piano as a child, Apple began composing her own songs when she was eight years old.<br>
    Her debut album, Tidal, written when Apple was seventeen, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for<br>
    Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". She followed with When the Pawn...(1999), produced by<br>
    Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially succesful and went certified platinum.<br><img src="f6.jpg" float ="right"> </p>
</p>

<p class="thirdparag">
   For her third album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album<br>
   in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with th production and opted not to release the record, loading fans to<br>
   erroneously protect Epic Records,believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-<br>
   produced without Brion and released in October 2005 to critical acclaim. She released her fourth studio album, The Idler<br>
   Wheel..., in 2012, which was followed by an extensive tour of the USA. The album received universal praise.<br><br>
